"""Centralized Nous Portal request tags.

Every Mangaba request that hits the Nous Portal — main agent loop, auxiliary
client (compression / titles / vision / web_extract / session_search / etc.),
and any future code path — must carry the same product-attribution tags so
Nous can attribute usage to Mangaba Agent and bucket it by client release.

Tag shape (sent in OpenAI-compatible ``extra_body['tags']``):

    [
        "product=mangaba-agent",
        "client=mangaba-client-v<__version__>",
    ]

The version is sourced live from ``mangaba_cli.__version__`` so it auto-aligns
to whatever release is installed; the release script
(``scripts/release.py``) regex-bumps that single string, and every Portal
request picks up the new tag on the next process start.

Why one helper instead of inlining the literal at each site:
* Four call sites (main loop profile, aux client, run_agent compression
  fallback, web_tools fallback) used to drift apart — see PR #24194 which
  only got the aux site, leaving the main loop sending a different tag set.
* Tests should assert the same tag list everywhere; centralizing makes that
  assertion a one-liner against this module.

Do NOT pre-compute these as module-level constants in the consumers. The
version can change at runtime (editable installs, hot-reload tooling), and
``mangaba_cli.__version__`` is the canonical source of truth.
