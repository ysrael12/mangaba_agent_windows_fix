    those tasks into ``skipped_nonspawnable`` instead of spawning, which

    The Windows update path now refuses to proceed when another
    ``mangaba.exe`` is detected (issue #26670). On a developer's Windows
    machine running the test suite via ``mangaba`` itself, this would
    flag the running agent as a concurrent instance and abort every
    ``cmd_update`` test. Tests that want to exercise the gate explicitly
    re-patch ``_detect_concurrent_mangaba_instances`` with their own
    return value — autouse here gives a clean default without touching
    the rest of the suite.

    Tests that need to call the REAL function (e.g. unit tests for the
    helper itself) opt out with ``@pytest.mark.real_concurrent_gate``.
