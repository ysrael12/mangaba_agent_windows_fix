# Profile Commands Reference

This page covers all commands related to [Mangaba profiles](../user-guide/profiles.md). For general CLI commands, see [CLI Commands Reference](./cli-commands.md).

## `mangaba profile`

```bash
mangaba profile <subcommand>
```

Top-level command for managing profiles. Running `mangaba profile` without a subcommand shows help.

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `list` | List all profiles. |
| `use` | Set the active (default) profile. |
| `create` | Create a new profile. |
| `delete` | Delete a profile. |
| `show` | Show details about a profile. |
| `alias` | Regenerate the shell alias for a profile. |
| `rename` | Rename a profile. |
| `export` | Export a profile to a tar.gz archive. |
| `import` | Import a profile from a tar.gz archive. |
| `install` | Install a profile distribution from a git URL or local directory. See [Profile Distributions](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md). |
| `update` | Re-pull a distribution-managed profile and re-apply its bundle. |
| `info` | Show distribution metadata for a profile (origin URL, commit, last update). |

## `mangaba profile list`

```bash
mangaba profile list
```

Lists all profiles. The currently active profile is marked with `*`.

**Example:**

```bash
$ mangaba profile list
  default
* work
  dev
  personal
```

No options.

## `mangaba profile use`

```bash
mangaba profile use <name>
```

Sets `<name>` as the active profile. All subsequent `mangaba` commands (without `-p`) will use this profile.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile name to activate. Use `default` to return to the base profile. |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile use work
mangaba profile use default
```

## `mangaba profile create`

```bash
mangaba profile create <name> [options]
```

Creates a new profile.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Name for the new profile. Must be a valid directory name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores). |
| `--clone` | Copy `config.yaml`, `.env`, and `SOUL.md` from the current profile. |
| `--clone-all` | Copy everything (config, memories, skills, sessions, state) from the current profile. |
| `--clone-from <profile>` | Clone from a specific profile instead of the current one. Used with `--clone` or `--clone-all`. |
| `--no-alias` | Skip wrapper script creation. |
| `--description "<text>"` | One- or two-sentence description of what this profile is good at. Used by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on role instead of profile name alone. Skip and add later via `mangaba profile describe`. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml`. |
| `--no-skills` | Create an **empty** profile with zero bundled skills enabled. Writes a `.no-skills` marker into the profile so future `mangaba update` runs won't re-seed the bundled set, and refuses to combine with `--clone` / `--clone-all` (which would copy skills in anyway). Useful for narrow orchestrator profiles or sandbox profiles that should not inherit the full skill catalog. |

Creating a profile does **not** make that profile directory the default project/workspace directory for terminal commands. If you want a profile to start in a specific project, set `terminal.cwd` in that profile's `config.yaml`.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Blank profile — needs full setup
mangaba profile create mybot

# Clone config only from current profile
mangaba profile create work --clone

# Clone everything from current profile
mangaba profile create backup --clone-all

# Clone config from a specific profile
mangaba profile create work2 --clone --clone-from work
```

## `mangaba profile describe`

```bash
mangaba profile describe [<name>] [options]
```

Read or set a profile's description. The description is consumed by the kanban orchestrator to route tasks based on what each profile is good at, rather than guessing from the profile name alone. Persisted in `<profile_dir>/profile.yaml` so it survives reboots and is shared with the gateway.

With no flags, prints the current description (or `(no description set for '<name>')` if empty).

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to describe. Required unless `--all --auto` is used. |
| `--text "<text>"` | Set the description to this exact text (user-authored). Overwrites any existing description. |
| `--auto` | Auto-generate a 1-2 sentence description via the auxiliary LLM, based on the profile's installed skills, configured model, and name. Configure the model under `auxiliary.profile_describer` in `config.yaml`. Auto-generated descriptions are marked `description_auto: true` so the dashboard can flag them for review. |
| `--overwrite` | With `--auto`, replace user-authored descriptions too (default: skip profiles whose description was set explicitly). |
| `--all` | With `--auto`, sweep every profile missing a description. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Read the current description
mangaba profile describe researcher

# Set it explicitly
mangaba profile describe researcher --text "Reads source code and writes findings."

# Let the LLM generate one
mangaba profile describe researcher --auto

# Fill in descriptions for every profile that doesn't have one
mangaba profile describe --all --auto
```

## `mangaba profile delete`

```bash
mangaba profile delete <name> [options]
```

Deletes a profile and removes its shell alias.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to delete. |
| `--yes`, `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt. |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile delete mybot
mangaba profile delete mybot --yes
```

:::warning
This permanently deletes the profile's entire directory including all config, memories, sessions, and skills. Cannot delete the currently active profile.
:::

## `mangaba profile show`

```bash
mangaba profile show <name>
```

Displays details about a profile including its home directory, configured model, gateway status, skills count, and configuration file status.

This shows the profile's Mangaba home directory, not the terminal working directory. Terminal commands start from `terminal.cwd` (or the launch directory on the local backend when `cwd: "."`).

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to inspect. |

**Example:**

```bash
$ mangaba profile show work
Profile: work
Path:    ~/.mangaba/profiles/work
Model:   anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 (anthropic)
Gateway: stopped
Skills:  12
.env:    exists
SOUL.md: exists
Alias:   ~/.local/bin/work
```

## `mangaba profile alias`

```bash
mangaba profile alias <name> [options]
```

Regenerates the shell alias script at `~/.local/bin/<name>`. Useful if the alias was accidentally deleted or if you need to update it after moving your Mangaba installation.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to create/update the alias for. |
| `--remove` | Remove the wrapper script instead of creating it. |
| `--name <alias>` | Custom alias name (default: profile name). |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile alias work
# Creates/updates ~/.local/bin/work

mangaba profile alias work --name mywork
# Creates ~/.local/bin/mywork

mangaba profile alias work --remove
# Removes the wrapper script
```

## `mangaba profile rename`

```bash
mangaba profile rename <old-name> <new-name>
```

Renames a profile. Updates the directory and shell alias.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<old-name>` | Current profile name. |
| `<new-name>` | New profile name. |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile rename mybot assistant
# ~/.mangaba/profiles/mybot → ~/.mangaba/profiles/assistant
# ~/.local/bin/mybot → ~/.local/bin/assistant
```

## `mangaba profile export`

```bash
mangaba profile export <name> [options]
```

Exports a profile as a compressed tar.gz archive.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Profile to export. |
| `-o`, `--output <path>` | Output file path (default: `<name>.tar.gz`). |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile export work
# Creates work.tar.gz in the current directory

mangaba profile export work -o ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
```

## `mangaba profile import`

```bash
mangaba profile import <archive> [options]
```

Imports a profile from a tar.gz archive.

| Argument / Option | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `<archive>` | Path to the tar.gz archive to import. |
| `--name <name>` | Name for the imported profile (default: inferred from archive). |

**Example:**

```bash
mangaba profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz
# Infers profile name from the archive

mangaba profile import ./work-2026-03-29.tar.gz --name work-restored
```

## Distribution commands

:::tip
**New to distributions?** Start with the [Profile Distributions user guide](../user-guide/profile-distributions.md) — it covers the why, when, and how with full examples. The sections below are a dry CLI reference for when you know what you want.
:::

Distributions turn a profile into a shareable, versioned artifact published
as a **git repository**. A recipient installs the distribution with a single
command and can update it in place later without touching their local
memories, sessions, or credentials.

`auth.json` and `.env` are never part of a distribution — they stay on the
installing user's machine.

The recipient's user data (memories, sessions, auth, their own edits to
`.env`) is always preserved across the initial install and subsequent
updates.

:::info
`mangaba profile export` / `import` are still the right commands for
**local backup and restore** of a profile on your own machine. Distribution
(`install` / `update` / `info`) is a separate concept: ship a profile via
git so someone else can install it.
:::

### `mangaba profile install`

```bash
mangaba profile install <source> [--name <name>] [--alias] [--force] [--yes]
```

Installs a profile distribution from a git URL or a local directory.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `<source>` | Git URL (`github.com/user/repo`, `https://...`, `git@...`, `ssh://`, `git://`) or a local directory containing `distribution.yaml` at its root. |
| `--name NAME` | Override the profile name from the manifest. |
| `--alias` | Also create a shell wrapper (e.g. `telemetry` → `mangaba -p telemetry`). |
| `--force` | Overwrite an existing profile of the same name. User data is still preserved. |
| `-y`, `--yes` | Skip the manifest-preview confirmation prompt. |

The installer shows the manifest, lists required env vars, and warns about
cron jobs before asking for confirmation. Required env vars go into a
`.env.EXAMPLE` file you copy to `.env` and fill in.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install from a GitHub repo (shorthand)
mangaba profile install github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution --alias

# Install from a full HTTPS git URL
mangaba profile install https://github.com/kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from SSH
mangaba profile install git@github.com:kyle/telemetry-distribution.git

# Install from a local directory during development
mangaba profile install ./telemetry/
```

### `mangaba profile update`

```bash
mangaba profile update <name> [--force-config] [--yes]
```

Re-clones the distribution from its recorded source and applies updates.
Distribution-owned files (SOUL.md, skills/, cron/, mcp.json) are
overwritten; user data (memories, sessions, auth, .env) is never touched.

`config.yaml` is preserved by default to keep your local overrides.
Pass `--force-config` to reset it to the distribution's shipped config.

### `mangaba profile info`

```bash
mangaba profile info <name>
```

Prints the profile's distribution manifest — name, version, required
Mangaba version, author, env var requirements, the source URL/path, and
the `Installed:` timestamp recorded when the distribution was last
`install`-ed or `update`-d. Useful for checking what a shared profile
needs before installing it, and for spotting "this profile was installed
6 months ago and hasn't been updated."

`mangaba profile list` also shows the distribution name and version in a
`Distribution` column, and `mangaba profile show <name>` / `delete <name>`
surface the source URL so you can tell at a glance which profiles came
from a git repo vs. were created locally.

### Private distributions

A private git repository works as a distribution source with no extra
configuration — the install shells out to your normal `git` binary, so
whatever authentication your shell is already set up for (SSH key,
`git credential` helper, GitHub CLI's stored HTTPS credentials) applies
transparently.

```bash
# Uses your SSH key, the same as any other `git clone`
mangaba profile install git@github.com:your-org/internal-assistant.git

# Uses your git credential helper
mangaba profile install https://github.com/your-org/internal-assistant.git
```

If a clone prompts for credentials interactively in your terminal during
install, that prompt flows through. Set up your auth the way you'd
normally use `git clone` against the same repo first, then install.

### Distribution manifest (`distribution.yaml`)

Every distribution has a `distribution.yaml` at the root of its repository:

```yaml
name: telemetry
version: 0.1.0
description: "Compliance monitoring harness"
mangaba_requires: ">=0.12.0"
author: "Your Name"
license: "MIT"
env_requires:
  - name: OPENAI_API_KEY
    description: "OpenAI API key"
    required: true
  - name: GRAPHITI_MCP_URL
    description: "Memory graph URL"
    required: false
    default: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse"
distribution_owned:   # optional; defaults to SOUL.md, config.yaml,
                      #   mcp.json, skills/, cron/, distribution.yaml
  - SOUL.md
  - skills/compliance/
  - cron/
```

`mangaba_requires` supports `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, or a bare
version (treated as `>=`). Install fails with a clear error if the current
Mangaba version doesn't satisfy the spec.

`distribution_owned` is optional. If set, only those paths are replaced on
update; anything else in the profile stays user-owned. If omitted, the
defaults above apply.

### Publishing a distribution

Authoring a distribution is just a git push:

1. In your profile directory, create `distribution.yaml` with at least `name`
   and `version`.
2. Initialize a git repo (or use an existing one) and push to GitHub /
   GitLab / any host Mangaba can clone from.
3. Tell recipients to run `mangaba profile install <your-repo-url>`.

Use git tags for versioned releases — recipients who clone `HEAD` get your
latest state, and you can always bump `version:` in the manifest.

## `mangaba -p` / `mangaba --profile`

```bash
mangaba -p <name> <command> [options]
mangaba --profile <name> <command> [options]
```

Global flag to run any Mangaba command under a specific profile without changing the sticky default. This overrides the active profile for the duration of the command.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-p <name>`, `--profile <name>` | Profile to use for this command. |

**Examples:**

```bash
mangaba -p work chat -q "Check the server status"
mangaba --profile dev gateway start
mangaba -p personal skills list
mangaba -p work config edit
```

## `mangaba completion`

```bash
mangaba completion <shell>
```

Generates shell completion scripts. Includes completions for profile names and profile subcommands.

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<shell>` | Shell to generate completions for: `bash`, `zsh`, or `fish`. |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Install completions
mangaba completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
mangaba completion zsh >> ~/.zshrc
mangaba completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/mangaba.fish

# Reload shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

After installation, tab completion works for:
- `mangaba profile <TAB>` — subcommands (list, use, create, etc.)
- `mangaba profile use <TAB>` — profile names
- `mangaba -p <TAB>` — profile names
