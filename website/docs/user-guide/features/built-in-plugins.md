# Built-in Plugins

Mangaba ships a small set of plugins bundled with the repository. They live under `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` and load automatically alongside user-installed plugins in `~/.mangaba/plugins/`. They use the same plugin surface as third-party plugins — hooks, tools, slash commands — just maintained in-tree.

See the [Plugins](/docs/user-guide/features/plugins) page for the general plugin system, and [Build a Mangaba Plugin](/docs/guides/build-a-mangaba-plugin) to write your own.

## How discovery works

The `PluginManager` scans four sources, in order:

1. **Bundled** — `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` (what this page documents)
2. **User** — `~/.mangaba/plugins/<name>/`
3. **Project** — `./.mangaba/plugins/<name>/` (requires `MANGABA_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS=1`)
4. **Pip entry points** — `mangaba_agent.plugins`

On name collision, later sources win — a user plugin named `disk-cleanup` would replace the bundled one.

`plugins/memory/` and `plugins/context_engine/` are deliberately excluded from bundled scanning. Those directories use their own discovery paths because memory providers and context engines are single-select providers configured through `mangaba memory setup` / `context.engine` in config.

## Bundled plugins are opt-in

Bundled plugins ship disabled. Discovery finds them (they appear in `mangaba plugins list` and the interactive `mangaba plugins` UI), but none load until you explicitly enable them:

```bash
mangaba plugins enable disk-cleanup
```

Or via `~/.mangaba/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  enabled:
    - disk-cleanup
```

This is the same mechanism user-installed plugins use. Bundled plugins are never auto-enabled — not on fresh install, not for existing users upgrading to a newer Mangaba. You always opt in explicitly.

To turn a bundled plugin off again:

```bash
mangaba plugins disable disk-cleanup
# or: remove it from plugins.enabled in config.yaml
```

## Currently shipped

The repo ships these bundled plugins under `plugins/`. All are opt-in — enable them via `mangaba plugins enable <name>`.

| Plugin | Kind | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `disk-cleanup` | hooks + slash command | Auto-track ephemeral files and clean them on session end |
| `observability/langfuse` | hooks | Trace turns / LLM calls / tools to [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) |
| `spotify` | backend (7 tools) | Native Spotify playback, queue, search, playlists, albums, library |
| `google_meet` | standalone | Join Meet calls, live-caption transcription, optional realtime duplex audio |
| `image_gen/openai` | image backend | OpenAI `gpt-image-2` image generation backend (alternative to FAL) |
| `image_gen/openai-codex` | image backend | OpenAI image generation via Codex OAuth |
| `image_gen/xai` | image backend | xAI `grok-2-image` backend |
| `mangaba-achievements` | dashboard tab | Steam-style collectible badges generated from your real Mangaba session history |
| `kanban/dashboard` | dashboard tab | Kanban board UI for the multi-agent dispatcher — tasks, comments, fan-out, board switching. See [Kanban Multi-Agent](./kanban.md). |

Memory providers (`plugins/memory/*`) and context engines (`plugins/context_engine/*`) are listed separately on [Memory Providers](./memory-providers.md) — they're managed through `mangaba memory` and `mangaba plugins` respectively. The full per-plugin detail for the two long-running hooks-based plugins follows.

### disk-cleanup

Auto-tracks and removes ephemeral files created during sessions — test scripts, temp outputs, cron logs, stale chrome profiles — without requiring the agent to remember to call a tool.

**How it works:**

| Hook | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `post_tool_call` | When `write_file` / `terminal` / `patch` creates a file matching `test_*`, `tmp_*`, or `*.test.*` inside `MANGABA_HOME` or `/tmp/mangaba-*`, track it silently as `test` / `temp` / `cron-output`. |
| `on_session_end` | If any test files were auto-tracked during the turn, run the safe `quick` cleanup and log a one-line summary. Stays silent otherwise. |

**Deletion rules:**

| Category | Threshold | Confirmation |
|---|---|---|
| `test` | every session end | Never |
| `temp` | >7 days since tracked | Never |
| `cron-output` | >14 days since tracked | Never |
| empty dirs under MANGABA_HOME | always | Never |
| `research` | >30 days, beyond 10 newest | Always (deep only) |
| `chrome-profile` | >14 days since tracked | Always (deep only) |
| files >500 MB | never auto | Always (deep only) |

**Slash command** — `/disk-cleanup` available in both CLI and gateway sessions:

```
/disk-cleanup status                     # breakdown + top-10 largest
/disk-cleanup dry-run                    # preview without deleting
/disk-cleanup quick                      # run safe cleanup now
/disk-cleanup deep                       # quick + list items needing confirmation
/disk-cleanup track <path> <category>    # manual tracking
/disk-cleanup forget <path>              # stop tracking (does not delete)
```

**State** — everything lives at `$MANGABA_HOME/disk-cleanup/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `tracked.json` | Tracked paths with category, size, and timestamp |
| `tracked.json.bak` | Atomic-write backup of the above |
| `cleanup.log` | Append-only audit trail of every track / skip / reject / delete |

**Safety** — cleanup only ever touches paths under `MANGABA_HOME` or `/tmp/mangaba-*`. Windows mounts (`/mnt/c/...`) are rejected. Well-known top-level state dirs (`logs/`, `memories/`, `sessions/`, `cron/`, `cache/`, `skills/`, `plugins/`, `disk-cleanup/` itself) are never removed even when empty — a fresh install does not get gutted on first session end.

**Enabling:** `mangaba plugins enable disk-cleanup` (or check the box in `mangaba plugins`).

**Disabling again:** `mangaba plugins disable disk-cleanup`.

### observability/langfuse

Traces Mangaba turns, LLM calls, and tool invocations to [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) — an open-source LLM observability platform. One span per turn, one generation per API call, one tool observation per tool call. Usage totals, per-type token counts, and cost estimates come out of Mangaba' canonical `agent.usage_pricing` numbers, so the Langfuse dashboard sees the same breakdown (input / output / `cache_read_input_tokens` / `cache_creation_input_tokens` / `reasoning_tokens`) that appears in `mangaba logs`.

The plugin is fail-open: no SDK installed, no credentials, or a transient Langfuse error — all turn into a silent no-op in the hook. The agent loop is never impacted.

**Setup:**

```bash
pip install langfuse
mangaba plugins enable observability/langfuse
```

Or check the box in the interactive `mangaba plugins` UI. Then put the credentials in `~/.mangaba/.env`:

```bash
MANGABA_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-lf-...
MANGABA_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-lf-...
MANGABA_LANGFUSE_BASE_URL=https://cloud.langfuse.com   # or your self-hosted URL
```

**How it works:**

| Hook | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `pre_api_request` / `pre_llm_call` | Open (or reuse) a per-turn root span "Mangaba turn". Start a `generation` child observation for this API call with serialized recent messages as input. |
| `post_api_request` / `post_llm_call` | Close the generation, attach `usage_details`, `cost_details`, `finish_reason`, assistant output + tool calls. If no tool calls and non-empty content, close the turn. |
| `pre_tool_call` | Start a `tool` child observation with sanitized `args`. |
| `post_tool_call` | Close the tool observation with sanitized `result`. `read_file` payloads get summarized (head + tail + omitted-line count) so a huge file read stays under `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_MAX_CHARS`. |

Session grouping keys off the Mangaba session ID (or task ID for sub-agents) via `langfuse.propagate_attributes`, so everything in a single `mangaba chat` session lives under one Langfuse session.

**Verify:**

```bash
mangaba plugins list                 # observability/langfuse should show "enabled"
mangaba chat -q "hello"              # check the Langfuse UI for a "Mangaba turn" trace
```

**Optional tuning** (in `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_ENV` | — | Environment tag on traces (`production`, `staging`, …) |
| `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_RELEASE` | — | Release/version tag |
| `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_SAMPLE_RATE` | `1.0` | Sampling rate passed to the SDK (0.0–1.0) |
| `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_MAX_CHARS` | `12000` | Per-field truncation for message content / tool args / tool results |
| `MANGABA_LANGFUSE_DEBUG` | `false` | Verbose plugin logging to `agent.log` |

Mangaba-prefixed and standard SDK env vars (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`) are both accepted — Mangaba-prefixed wins when both are set.

**Performance:** the Langfuse client is cached after the first hook call. If credentials or SDK are missing, that decision is also cached — subsequent hooks fast-return without re-checking env vars or reloading config.

**Disabling:** `mangaba plugins disable observability/langfuse`. The plugin module is still discovered, but no module code runs until you re-enable.

### google_meet

Lets the agent **join, transcribe, and participate in Google Meet calls** — take notes on a meeting, summarize the back-and-forth after, follow up on specific points, and (optionally) speak replies back into the call via TTS.

**What it adds:**

- A headless virtual participant that joins a Meet URL using browser automation
- Live transcription of the meeting audio via the configured STT provider
- A `meet_summarize` / `meet_speak` / `meet_followup` toolset the agent invokes to act on what it heard
- Post-meeting artifacts (transcript, speaker-attributed notes, action items) saved under `~/.mangaba/cache/google_meet/<meeting_id>/`

**Setup:**

```bash
mangaba plugins enable google_meet
# Prompts you to sign in via the plugin's OAuth flow on first use —
# needs a Google account with Meet access. Host approval may be required
# if the meeting enforces "only invited participants can join".
```

Usage from chat:

> "Join meet.google.com/abc-defg-hij and take notes. After the call, send me a summary with action items."

The agent kicks off the meeting join, streams the transcription back into its context as the call proceeds, and produces a structured summary when the meeting ends (or when you tell it to stop).

**When to use it:** recurring standups where you want a bot to transcribe + summarize for async attendees; deposition-style interviews where you want structured notes; any case where you'd otherwise need Fireflies / Otter / Grain. When you'd rather not have an AI listening in — don't enable it.

**Disabling:** `mangaba plugins disable google_meet`. Any cached transcripts and recordings stay in `~/.mangaba/cache/google_meet/` until you remove them.

### mangaba-achievements

Adds a **Steam-style achievements tab to the dashboard** — 60+ collectible, tiered badges generated from your real Mangaba session history. Tool-chain feats, debugging patterns, vibe-coding streaks, skill/memory usage, model/provider variety, lifestyle quirks (weekend and night sessions). Originally authored by [@PCinkusz](https://github.com/PCinkusz) as an external plugin; brought in-tree so it stays in lockstep with Mangaba feature changes.

**How it works:**

- Scans your entire `~/.mangaba/state.db` session history on the dashboard backend
- Per-session stats are cached by `(started_at, last_active)` fingerprint, so only new or changed sessions re-analyze on subsequent scans
- First-ever scan runs in a background thread — the dashboard never blocks waiting for it, even on databases with thousands of sessions
- Unlock state is persisted to `$MANGABA_HOME/plugins/mangaba-achievements/state.json`

**Tier progression:** Copper → Silver → Gold → Diamond → Olympian. Each card exposes a "What counts" section listing the exact metric being tracked.

**Achievement states:**

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Unlocked | At least one tier achieved |
| Discovered | Known achievement, progress visible, not yet earned |
| Secret | Hidden until Mangaba detects the first related signal in your history |

**API** — routes mount under `/api/plugins/mangaba-achievements/`:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /achievements` | Full catalog with per-badge unlock state (returns a pending placeholder while the first cold scan is running) |
| `GET /scan-status` | State of the background scanner: `idle` / `running` / `failed`, last duration, run count |
| `GET /recent-unlocks` | Twenty most recently unlocked badges, newest first |
| `GET /sessions/{id}/badges` | Badges earned primarily in one specific session |
| `POST /rescan` | Manual synchronous rescan (blocks; use when the user clicks the rescan button) |
| `POST /reset-state` | Clear unlock history and cached snapshot |

**State files** — live under `$MANGABA_HOME/plugins/mangaba-achievements/`:

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `state.json` | Unlock history: which badges you've earned and when. Stable across Mangaba updates. |
| `scan_snapshot.json` | Last completed scan payload (served immediately on dashboard load) |
| `scan_checkpoint.json` | Per-session stats cache keyed by fingerprint (makes warm rescans fast) |

**Performance notes:**

- Cold scan on ~8,000 sessions takes a few minutes. It runs in a background thread on first dashboard request; the UI sees a pending placeholder and polls `/scan-status`.
- **Incremental results during a cold scan** — the scanner publishes a partial snapshot every ~250 sessions so each dashboard refresh shows more badges unlocked as the scan progresses. No minute-long stare at zeros.
- Warm rescan reuses per-session stats for every session whose `started_at` + `last_active` fingerprint matches the checkpoint — completes in seconds even on large histories.
- The in-memory snapshot TTL is 120s; stale requests serve the old snapshot immediately and kick a background refresh. You never wait on a spinner just because TTL expired.

**Enabling:** Nothing to enable — `mangaba-achievements` is a dashboard-only plugin (no lifecycle hooks, no model-visible tools). It auto-registers as a tab in `mangaba dashboard` on first launch. The `plugins.enabled` config only gates lifecycle/tool plugins; dashboard plugins are discovered purely via their `dashboard/manifest.json`.

**Opting out:** Delete or rename `plugins/mangaba-achievements/dashboard/manifest.json`, or override it with a user plugin of the same name in `~/.mangaba/plugins/mangaba-achievements/` that ships no dashboard. The plugin's state files under `$MANGABA_HOME/plugins/mangaba-achievements/` survive — reinstalling preserves your unlock history.

## Adding a bundled plugin

Bundled plugins are written exactly like any other Mangaba plugin — see [Build a Mangaba Plugin](/docs/guides/build-a-mangaba-plugin). The only differences are:

- Directory lives at `<repo>/plugins/<name>/` instead of `~/.mangaba/plugins/<name>/`
- Manifest source is reported as `bundled` in `mangaba plugins list`
- User plugins with the same name override the bundled version

A plugin is a good candidate for bundling when:

- It has no optional dependencies (or they're already `pip install .[all]` deps)
- The behaviour benefits most users and is opt-out rather than opt-in
- The logic ties into lifecycle hooks that the agent would otherwise have to remember to invoke
- It complements a core capability without expanding the model-visible tool surface

Counter-examples — things that should stay as user-installable plugins, not bundled: third-party integrations with API keys, niche workflows, large dependency trees, anything that would meaningfully change agent behaviour by default.
